In my own terms cybersecurity is the process of preventing, protecting and recovering data and digital assets from theft or damage.</p><p>The cybersecurity field is vast and there are so many fields within it ranging from :</p><ul><li>Application security.</li><li>Data loss prevention.</li><li>Forensics.</li><li>Incident response.</li><li>Network security.</li><li>Security architecture.</li><li>Threat intelligence.</li><li>Vulnerability management.</li></ul><p>My field of interest is web app, mobile app, network and infrastructure penetration testing.</p><p>So how did I get started? Basically you have to start from the basics. A good foundation is key for one to succeed in this field.</p><p>I first started with networking and I had to learn how networks work and how data is transmitted to and fro. Afterwards I proceeded to learn python programming language which is also key for various reasons. I then landed to introduction to penetration testing and my journey has been to grow and develop my skills in the field.</p><p>For those who want to get into the field first of all truly know what you are interested in and thereafter start. Take your time to learn your field of interest. I cannot promise you that it is easy but with determination, self belief and drive you will reach your goals.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p> </p><h4></h4>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
